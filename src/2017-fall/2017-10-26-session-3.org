* Agenda

| 7:00 - 7:15 | Q&A & Warm up / Codecademy time |
| 7:15 | Roadmap for the fall and some background on HTML |
| 7:30ish | Codecademy time |
| 8:30ish |Wrap up |

* Warm up time

Ask questions

or

Keep going on Codecademy lessons

* HTML comments
To put a comment in:

~<!-- your comment -->~

Doesn't have to be all on one line.

* Tags: begin/end vs. self-closing

Some tags have open and close:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<h1> headline </h1>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Some are self-closing, when there's not anything to enclose, like ~img~:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<img src="http://foo.com/bar.jpg"/>
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Does white space matter?

Pretty much, no.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<title> My title </title>
#+END_EXAMPLE

or

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<title>
My
title
</title>
#+END_EXAMPLE

* How do I put in a less than sign? <

To put in a < sign:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
&lt;
#+END_EXAMPLE

There are many other characters like this, such as ~&gt;~, etc.
* Key points about CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

- Lets you separate the visual appearance from the content
  - Change visual design without changing every web page
  - Can provide different formats for computer, mobile device, printing, etc.

Examples: [[https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp][CSS Introduction]]

* Basic structure of CSS rules
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
.myclass h2 { color: purple; }

#myid { background: blue; }

#+END_EXAMPLE

Example selectors:
- ~.myclass~ matches a ~class=~ in the HTML
- ~h2~ applies to the ~h2~ HTML element
- ~#myid~ applies to HTML tags with an ~id=~ attribute

* What's this "cascading" thing?

Styles can come from different places, and each has a priority (simplified here)

1. Inline - HTML "style" attribute
2. User-defined - if the user set something in the browser
3. More specific rules
4. Most recently seen rule
5. Inherit from parent (e.g., setting the font for a div class)
6. CSS defined in the HTML document
7. Browser defaults
